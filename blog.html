        <h3>What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
        <p>Web documents have a programming interface called the Document Object Model (DOM). Since that software can alter the document's structure, appearance, and content, it serves as a representation of the page. Programming languages can communicate with a page by interacting with the nodes and objects that the DOM uses to represent the document. DOM is a representation of the web page that is object-oriented and may be altered using a scripting language like JavaScript.</p>

        <h3> How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
        <p>There are many ways to select HTML element. They are selected mostly by using methods by the elements class name, id, or tagname. Some of the methods are listed below_</p>
        <ul>
            <li>document.getElementsByTagName()</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByClassName()</li>
            <li>document.getElementById()</li>
            <li>document.querySelector()</li>
            <li>document.querySelectorAll()</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p>Event bubble is a form of DOM event propagation in which the event initially triggers on the innermost target element and then subsequently triggers on the target element's ancestors in the same nesting hierarchy until it reaches the outermost DOM element or document object. To stop even bubbling we have to stop it's propagation.</p>

        <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
        <p>A callback function is a function that is sent to another function as an argument. This approach allows one function to call another. A callback function can be executed after another function has completed. In JavaScript functions are executed in the order they are called, so by using callback functions we can have some more control over when to execute a function</p>
